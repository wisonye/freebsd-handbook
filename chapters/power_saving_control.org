=hiadaptive=: Operation mode. More info at =powerd(8)=.

=-i=: Specifies the CPU load percent level when adaptive mode should begin to degrade performance to save power.

=-r=: Specifies the CPU load percent level where adaptive mode should consider the CPU running and increase performance.

=-N=: Treat "nice" time as idle for the purpose of load calculation; i.e., do not increase the CPU frequency if the CPU is only busy with "nice" processes.
