* WIFI

** Print out your WIFI chipset driver/model

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  sysctl net.wlan.devices

  # net.wlan.devices: iwlwifi0
#+END_SRC

That means =iwlwifi0= is the value your wanted.


** Configurations

*** If you configure WIFI during installing FreeBSD

**** =/etc/rc.conf=

  You should see the following (WIFI related) settings insdie =/etc/rc.conf=:

  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
    wlans_iwlwifi0="wlan0"
    ifconfig_wlan0="WPA DHCP"
    # ifconfig_wlan0="group pfnic WPA DHCP"
    create_args_wlan0="country NZ regdomain APAC2"
  #+END_SRC

  Optional =group pfnic= is used to set the NIC with the given group name (=pnfic=) , then you can use that group name on firewall setttings when needed.


**** =/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf=

  You should see the following (WIFI related) settings insdie =/etc/rc.conf=:

  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
    ctrl_interface=/var/run/wpa_supplicant
    eapol_version=2
    ap_scan=1
    fast_reauth=1

    network={
            ssid="YOUR_SSID_HERE"
            scan_ssid=0
            psk="YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE"
            priority=5
    }
    network={
            priority=0
            key_mgmt=NONE
    }
  #+END_SRC

  Make sure to change the =scan_ssid=1= if you're using a hidden SSID!!!
  Make sure to change the =scan_ssid=1= if you're using a hidden SSID!!!
  Make sure to change the =scan_ssid=1= if you're using a hidden SSID!!!



*** If you skip WIFI during installing FreeBSD

**** Generate the =/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf=

Run the following command to create =/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf=:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  wpa_passphrase YOUR_SSID YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD > /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf
#+END_SRC


So, it should look like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  network={
      scan_ssid=1
      ssid="YOUR_SSID"
      psk=YOUR_ENCRYPTED_WIFI_PASSWORD
  }
#+END_SRC

Make sure put the =scan_ssid=1= there if you're using a hidden SSID!!!
Make sure to change the =scan_ssid=1= if you're using a hidden SSID!!!
Make sure to change the =scan_ssid=1= if you're using a hidden SSID!!!


**** Add wireless card settings to =/etc/rc.conf=

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  wlans_iwlwifi0="wlan0"
  ifconfig_wlan0="WPA DHCP"
  # ifconfig_wlan0="group pfnic WPA DHCP"
  create_args_wlan0="country NZ regdomain APAC2"
#+END_SRC

Optional =group pfnic= is used to set the NIC with the given group name (=pnfic=) , then you can use that group name on firewall setttings when needed.

Pay attentions:

1. ~wlans_XXXX="wlan0"~

    That =XXXX= comes from the output of =sysctl net.wlan.devices=!!!


2. That =country XX= is the most important setting, make sure to change to your local country code which defines in =/etc/regdomain.xml=!!! It won't work if missing the correct country code.


** For =minisforum TH80=

This mini pc use the =iwlwifi= Intel WIFI driver, here is the =man iwlwifi= information:

#+BEGIN_SRC text
  
  Name
          iwlwifi â€“ Intel IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n/ac/ax wireless network driver

  SYNOPSIS
          The driver will auto-load without any user interaction using devmatch(8)
          if enabled in rc.conf(5).

          Only if auto-loading is explicitly disabled, place the following lines in
          rc.conf(5) to manually load the driver as a module at boot time:

              kld_list="${kld_list} if_iwlwifi"

          The driver should automatically load any iwlwififw(4) firmware needed for
          the particular chipset.

          It is discouraged to load the driver from loader(8).
#+END_SRC


As it said =if_iwlwifi= driver will auto-load, that's why you don't need to add it to =/etc/rc.conf= explicitly if you've already added wireless card settings to =/etc/rc.conf=.

You can run the following command to confirm it has been loaded or not:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  kldstat | rg iwl

  # 12    1 0xffffffff84d3f000    87190 if_iwlwifi.ko
#+END_SRC


Here is my =TH80= wireless card =ifconfig= output:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash

Wireless card model is =Intel AX210NGW= and use =iwlwifi= driver, but the current driver has a few problems:

*** Keep printing out =No beacon heard and the session protection is over already...= on the first connection when you boot the PC:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  iwlwifi0: No beacon heard and the session protection is over already...
  wlan0: link state changed to DOWN
  wlan0 link state up -> down
  wlan0: link state changed to UP
  DHCPDISCOVER on wlan0 to 255.255.255.255 port 67 interval 5
  wlan0 link state down -> up
  DHCPDISCOVER on wlan0 to 255.255.255.255 port 67 interval 6
  iwlwifi0: No beacon heard and the session protection is over already...
  wlan0: link state changed to DOWN
  wlan0 link state up -> down
  wlan0: link state changed to UP
  wlan0 link state down -> up
  DHCPDISCOVER on wlan0 to 255.255.255.255 port 67 interval 3
  iwlwifi0: No beacon heard and the session protection is over already...
  wlan0: link state changed to DOWN
#+END_SRC

And it repeats over and over again until it connects successfully...


There is NO official fix yet, the info I found in this issue [[https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=203709#c304][comment 304]]

The temporary workaround is that:

- Set the =5G= channel to a fixed channel, like =52= I'm using

- Assigned the static DHCP to the card's MAC address

So, it seems work very well so far:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  ssid SSID_HERE channel 52 (5260 MHz 11a) bssid 34:58:40:ca:f8:bc
  regdomain APAC country NZ authmode WPA2/802.11i privacy ON
#+END_SRC


*** The Bluetooth functionality doesn't work at all

That's because this [[https://cgit.freebsd.org/src/commit/?=id=d74c589ead91118a46370edc30f10e7d65ed2636][commit]] 

That's saying =Intel AX201NGW= bluetooth dev just ignore in the following source code:

=/sys/netgraph/bluetooth/drivers/ubt/ng_ubt.c= has the following setting in =ubt_ignore_deves=:


#+BEGIN_SRC c
  static const STRUCT_USB_HOST_ID ubt_ignore_devs[] = 
  {
          /*
           ,* Some Intel controllers are not yet supported by ng_ubt_intel and
           ,* should be ignored.
           ,*/
          { USB_VPI(USB_VENDOR_INTEL2, 0x0032, 0) },
          { USB_VPI(USB_VENDOR_INTEL2, 0x0033, 0) },
  };
#+END_SRC

That =0x0032= it the =Intel AX201NGW= which you can confirm by running =doas usbconfig=:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  doas usbconfig

  # ugen0.1: <Intel XHCI root HUB> at usbus0, cfg=0 md=HOST spd=SUPER (5.0Gbps) pwr=SAVE (0mA)
  # ugen0.2: <Logitech USB Receiver> at usbus0, cfg=0 md=HOST spd=FULL (12Mbps) pwr=ON (98mA)
  # ugen0.3: <AONE Varmilo Keyboard> at usbus0, cfg=0 md=HOST spd=FULL (12Mbps) pwr=ON (350mA)
  ugen0.4: <vendor 0x8087 product 0x0032> at usbus0, cfg=0 md=HOST spd=FULL (12Mbps) pwr=ON (100mA)
#+END_SRC

As you can see, =ugen0.4: <vendor 0x8087 product 0x0032>= is an unrecognized device!!!

** Slow WIFI issue

=FreeBSD= WIFI speed can't reach =ac= standard yet, so it's pretty slow at this moment, here is the description from =man iwlwifi=:

#+BEGIN_SRC text
  The driver uses the linuxkpi_wlan and linuxkpi compat framework to bridge
  between the Linux and native FreeBSD driver code as well as to the native
  net80211(4) wireless stack.

  While iwlwifi supports all 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac/ax the compatibility code
  currently only supports 802.11 a/b/g modes.  Support for 802.11 n/ac is
  to come. 802.11ax and 6Ghz support are planned.
#+END_SRC

So, that's how =wifibox= comes to the rescue.

Plz read this chapter for more details: [[file:wifibox-to-improve-wifi-speed.org][wifibox to improve WIFI speed]]
