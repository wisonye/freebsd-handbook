* Fix terminal type issue in SSH

If you're trying to open =vi= via =SSH=, you might see the following error and fail to open =vi=:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  vi: alacritty: unknown terminal type 
#+END_SRC


That's because the newly installed =FreeBSD= doesn't have your host mahcine =TERM= terminfo settings yet!

You need to install the expected =terminfo= on the =FreeBSD=. For example, your host machine use ~alacritty~ terminfo:


#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  echo $TERM

  # alacritty
#+END_SRC


Temporary quick fix:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  export TERM=xterm
#+END_SRC


Permanent fix;

Here is what you need to do on the =FreeBSD=:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  # doas pkg install alacritty

  #
  # Make sure you're `root`!
  #
  su
  curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alacritty/alacritty/master/extra/alacritty.info | tic -x -
#+END_SRC
