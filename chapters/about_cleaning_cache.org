* About cleaning cache

After running =FreeBSD= for a while, you will notice that your disk free space keeps reducing and never stop, that should be a signal that you should clean your cache. Usually, it will save over =GB= disk space:)

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  #
  # Show how much your cache hold the disk space and remove the bigger you see
  #
  # dust -d1 ~/.cache
  /usr/bin/du -ch -d1 ~/.cache

  #
  # Removing a package may leave behind dependencies which are no longer required.
  # Unneeded packages that were installed as dependencies (leaf packages) can be
  # automatically detected and removed using:
  #
  doas pkg autoremove

  #
  # Clean the entire cache which located at `/var/cache/pkg`
  #
  # `--dry-run` only show what will be affected but doesn't execute
  #
  doas pkg clean --dry-run --all
  # The following package files will be deleted:
  #         /var/cache/pkg/doas-6.3p9~75e7962988.pkg
  #         /var/cache/pkg/doas-6.3p9.pkg
  #         /var/cache/pkg/lsblk-3.7~149284eee5.pkg
  #         /var/cache/pkg/lsblk-3.7.pkg
  # The cleanup will free 29 KiB

  #
  # After confirming, you can run the real cleanup:
  #
  doas pkg clean --all

  #
  # Remove cargo cache
  #
  cargo cache --autoclean

  #
  # After that, calculate again, it should get big improved.
  #
  # dust -d1 ~/.cache
  /usr/bin/du -ch -d1 ~/.cache
#+END_SRC
