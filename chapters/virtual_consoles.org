* Virtual consoles

[[https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/basics/#consoles][here]] is the official doc.

What is =Getty=?

After reboot, you will see a default terminal login prompt which prints with =ttyv0=, that's the =Virtual console=.

In =FreeBSD=, =Virtual console= runs a =getty=, it prompts for a login name and invokes the =/usr/bin/login= command.

The =ttyv0= is call =system console=, =ttyv1~7= are normal virtual consoles, =ttyv8= is for the =X= which means your =DE= (Desktop Environment) or =WM= (Window Manager).

You can press =Alt+F1 ~ F8= to switch between =ttyv0 ~ ttyv7=. 

You can press =Alt+F9= to switch back to =X=.

When using Xorg as a graphical console, press =Ctrl+Alt+F1 ~ F8= to return to a text-based virtual console.

You can disable any virutal console by commenting the particular line in =/etc/ttys=, but DO NOT comment the =ttyv0=!!!
