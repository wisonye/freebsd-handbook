* Ethernet

Set up your ethernet NIC to use =DHCP= in =/etc/rc.conf=
 
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  ifconfig_igc0="DHCP"
  # ifconfig_igc0="group pfnic DHCP"
#+END_SRC

Optional =group pfnic= is used to set the NIC with the given group name (=pnfic=) , then you can use that group name on firewall setttings when needed.


After making networking settings related changes, you have to restart =netif= service to take affect:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  doas service netif restart
#+END_SRC
