** Install linux steam wrapper and linux compatibility packages

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  doas pkg install linux-steam-utils
#+END_SRC


*** Enable =linux= service

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  doas sysrc linux_enable=YES
#+END_SRC

You can have a look at ~/etc/rc.d/linux~ script, it does the following things:

- Load =linux/linux64= kernel modules

- Mount the following filesystems into =/compat/linux= folder:

  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
    devfs   /compat/linux/dev  devfs       rw      0       0
    fdescfs   /compat/linux/fd  fdescfs       rw,linrdlnk      0       0
    linprocfs   /compat/linux/proc  linprocfs       rw      0       0
    linsysfs    /compat/linux/sys   linsysfs        rw      0       0
    tmpfs    /compat/linux/dev/shm  tmpfs   rw,mode=1777    0       0
  #+END_SRC

    If you don't want the automount, you can run this to stop that behaviour:

    #+BEGIN_SRC bash
      doas sysrc linux_mounts_enable=NO
    #+END_SRC

    By the way, Filesystems mounted by the ~/etc/rc.d/linux~ script will not work for Linux processes inside =chroots= or =jails=; if needed, you have to configure them in =/etc/fstab=.


*** Reboot to take affect


** Setup

After you install =linux-steam-utils=, you will see the following hints:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash

  Message from linux-steam-utils-20231009:

  Please note, this is an unofficial wrapper for the Steam client
  and as such it is supported on a best effort basis.

  Limitations:

  - Sandbox is disabled for the web browser component.
  - Valve Anti-Cheat doesn't work with FreeBSD < 13.
  - No controller input, no streaming, no VR.
  - No support for Linux Proton builds.

  Additional dependencies:
  - If you use an NVIDIA card, you need to install a suitable
    x11/linux-nvidia-libs(-xxx) port.

  Steam setup:

  1. Create a dedicated FreeBSD non-wheel user account for Steam. Switch to it.
  2. Run `steam-install` to download the Steam bootstrap executable.
  3. Run `steam` to download updates and start Steam.

  For the list of tested Linux games see https://github.com/shkhln/linuxulator-steam-utils/wiki/Compatibility.

  Native Proton setup (optional, semi-experimental):

  1. Run `sudo pkg install wine-proton libc6-shim python3`.
  2. Run `/usr/local/wine-proton/bin/pkg32.sh install wine-proton mesa-dri`.
  3. In Steam install Proton 8.0 (appid 2348590).
  4. Run `lsu-register-proton` to register emulators/wine-proton as a compatibility tool.
  5. Restart Steam.

  To enable emulators/wine-proton right click a game title in Steam,
#+END_SRC

So, here are the steps you need to do one-by-one:


*** Create =steam= user

Make sure put new user into =video= group!!!
Make sure put new user into =video= group!!!
Make sure put new user into =video= group!!!

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  doas adduser

  # Username: steam
  # Full name: Steam
  # Uid (Leave empty for default):
  # Login group [steam]:
  # Login group is steam. Invite steam into other groups? []: video
  # Login class [default]:
  # Shell (sh csh tcsh bash rbash fish git-shell nologin) [sh]:
  # Home directory [/home/steam]:
  # Home directory permissions (Leave empty for default):
  # Use password-based authentication? [yes]:
  # Use an empty password? (yes/no) [no]:
  # Use a random password? (yes/no) [no]:
  # Enter password:
  # Enter password again:
  # Lock out the account after creation? [no]:
  # Username   : steam
  # Password   : *****
  # Full Name  : Steam
  # Uid        : 1002
  # Class      :
  # Groups     : steam video
  # Home       : /home/steam
  # Home Mode  :
  # Shell      : /bin/sh
  # Locked     : no
  # OK? (yes/no) [yes]:
  # adduser: INFO: Successfully added (steam) to the user database.
  # Add another user? (yes/no) [no]:
  # Goodbye!
#+END_SRC


*** Creaetr =/var/lib/dbus/machine-id=

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  doas mkdir -p /var/lib/dbus 
  doas /usr/local/bin/dbus-uuidgen --ensure=/var/lib/dbus/machine-id
#+END_SRC


*** Switch to =steam= user

You have to re-login with =steam= user and start a new =hyprland= process (environment) to make it work!!!
You have to re-login with =steam= user and start a new =hyprland= process (environment) to make it work!!!
You have to re-login with =steam= user and start a new =hyprland= process (environment) to make it work!!!

That means you need to copy your current user's =shell/hyprland/waybar= or related configuration to =/home/steam/.config= to make it run hyprland correctly:)


*** Run =steam-install= to download the Steam bootstrap executable.

After you started =hyprland= as =steam= user, then run this:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  $ steam-install

And run this:
