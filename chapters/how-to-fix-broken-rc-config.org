* How to fix a failed boot

When you make a mistake in the =/etc/rc.conf= or another startup file, it might cause the =FreeBSD= not to boot or keep rebooting. So what can you do in that situation???

Reboot and choose =Single user mode= (or type =boot -s= in the boot prompt), press =Enter= to access the default shell or type your preferred shell (e.g. =/usr/local/bin/fish=).

After that, run the following commands to fix the broken =/etc/rc.conf=:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  #
  # Option 1: You must re-mount the root file system into `read/write` mode!!!
  #
  mount -urw

  #
  # Option 2: Or you can temporary turn off the `readonly` flag like this
  #
  zfs set readonly=false zroot/ROOT/default

  #
  # Now, fix it:)
  #
  /usr/local/bin/nvim /etc/rc.conf
#+END_SRC
