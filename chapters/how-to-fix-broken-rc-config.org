* How to fix broken =/etc/rc.conf=

When you make a mistake in the =/etc/rc.conf= or another startup file, it might cause the =FreeBSD= not to boot or keep rebooting. So what can you do in that situation???

Reboot and choose =Single user mode= (or type =boot -s= in the boot prompt), press =Enter= to access the default shell or type your preferred shell (e.g. =/usr/local/bin/fish=).

And then run =mount -urw /= to re-mount the root file system into =read/write= mode, now you're able to fix the broken =/etc//rc.conf=:)
