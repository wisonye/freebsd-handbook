* Install =X=

The =X= Window System (=X11=, or simply =X=) is a windowing system for bitmap displays, common on Unix-like operating systems. It provides the basic framework for a GUI environment:

- Drawing
- Moving windows
- Interact with mouse and keyboard


It's =Client Server= architecture.

Official document is [[https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/x11][here]].

    doas pw groupmod video -m wison

    # Confirm
    groups wison
    # wison whell video
#+END_SRC



** How to trouleshoot the =X= failure

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  #
  # Make sure `X` is not started and remove the Xorg log file
  #
  doas rm -rf /var/log/Xorg.0.log*

  #
  # Relogin and startx again
  #
  startx
#+END_SRC

Now, have a look at the =/var/log/Xorg.0.log= to figure out the error you got:)
