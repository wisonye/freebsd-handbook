* Install GPU drivers

You shoul have a look at the [[https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/x11/#x-graphic-card-drivers][graphic-card-driver]] official doc for more details!!!
Also, another doc is here: [[https://wiki.freebsd.org/Graphics][FreeBSD-Graphics]].

** List your GPU info

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  pciconf -lv|grep -B4 VGA
#+END_SRC


** Install your GPU driver

The =Direct Rendering Manager (DRM)= is a subsystem of the Linux kernel responsible for interfacing with GPUs of modern video cards.

=drm-kmod=: DRM kernel module.

*** Intel

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  pkg install drm-kmod
#+END_SRC

And then add the following settings to ~/etc/rc.conf~ to load GPU driver module:

#+BEGIN_SRC text
  sysrc kld_list+=i915kms  
#+END_SRC


*** AMD

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  pkg install drm-kmod
#+END_SRC

And then add the following settings to ~/etc/rc.conf~ to load GPU driver module:

#+BEGIN_SRC text
  sysrc kld_list+=amdgpu
#+END_SRC


** Optionally, install =drm_info= to print the device info


** Paralles Desktop GPU issue

If you run =dmesg -a= and search for =vga=, then you should be able to the following logs:

#+BEGIN_SRC text
  vgapci0: <VGA-compatible display> port 0xc000-0xc01f mem 0xc0000000-0xcfffffff at device 0.0 on pci1
  1 vgapci0: Boot video device
  2 pci0: <unknown> at device 3.0 (no driver attached)
#+END_SRC

And that =pci0= is the GPU:

#+BEGIN_SRC text
  vgapci0@pci0:1:0:0:     class=0x030000 rev=0x00 hdr=0x00 vendor=0x1ab8 device=0x4005 subvendor=0x1ab8 subdevice=0x0400
    vendor     = 'Parallels, Inc.'
    device     = 'Accelerated Virtual Video Adapter'
    class      = display
    subclass   = VGA
#+END_SRC

That said no =virtio-gpu= driver!!!

But =FreeBSD 14= does have the =virtio-gpu= driver, if you run ~man virtio-gpu~, then you will see this:

#+BEGIN_SRC text
  VIRTIO_GPU(4)          FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual          VIRTIO_GPU(4)

  NAME
       virtio_gpu â€“ VirtIO GPU driver

  SYNOPSIS
       To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
       kernel configuration file:

             device virtio_gpu

  DESCRIPTION
       The virtio_gpu device driver provides support for VirtIO gpu devices to
       create a vt(4) console.

  SEE ALSO
       virtio(4) vt(4)

  HISTORY
       The virtio_gpu driver first appeared in FreeBSD 14.0.

  FreeBSD 14.0-RELEASE-p3         August 14, 2023        FreeBSD 14.0-RELEASE-p3
#+END_SRC


But after I rebuilt my custom kernel (=PARALLELS_VM=) with the =virtio_gpu= driver, it still doesn't work. =FreeBSD= still load the =vga= driver for the =pci0= deivce (~vgapci0@pci0~) rather than the =virtio_gpu= driver!!!
